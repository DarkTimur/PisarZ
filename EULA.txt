Use of the Freeware by you shall be governed entirely by the terms and conditions of such license.
2. UPGRADES. 
To use a Software Product identified as an upgrade, you must first be licensed for the original Software Product identified by Dark_Timur as eligible for the upgrade. After upgrading, you may no longer use the original Software Product that formed the basis for your upgrade eligibility.
3. ADDITIONAL SOFTWARE. 
This EULA applies to updates or supplements to the original Software Product provided by Dark_Timur unless Dark_Timur provides other terms along with the update or supplement. In case of a conflict between such terms, the other terms will prevail.
4. TRANSFER.
a.) Third Party. The Software Product may only be transferred to another end user as part of a transfer of the PisarZ on which it is installed. Any transfer must include all component parts, media, printed materials and this EULA. The transfer may not be an indirect transfer, such as a consignment.

Nothing contained herein shall be construed, expressly or implicitly, as transferring any right, license or title to you other than those explicitly granted under this EULA. Unauthorized copying of the Software Product or failure to comply with the above restrictions will result in automatic termination of this Agreement and will constitute immediate, irreparable harm to Dark_Timur for which monetary damages would be an inadequate remedy, in which case injunctive relief will be an appropriate remedy for such breach.

The Software Product is offered on an "AS-IS" basis and Dark_Timur does NOT warrant that the functions contained in the Software Product will meet your requirements or that the operation of the Software Product will be uninterrupted or error free.

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, Dark_Timur AND ITS SUPPLIERS PROVIDE THE SOFTWARE PRODUCT "AS IS" AND WITH ALL FAULTS, AND HEREBY DISCLAIM ALL OTHER WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS, EITHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, WARRANTIES OF TITLE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES, DUTIES OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND OF LACK OF VIRUSES ALL WITH REGARD TO THE SOFTWARE PRODUCT. NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY Dark_Timur OR A Dark_Timur AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY. Some states/jurisdictions do not allow exclusion of implied warranties or limitations on the duration of implied warranties, so the above disclaimer may not apply to you in its entirety. IN NO EVENT DOES Dark_Timur PROVIDE ANY WARRANTY OR REPRESENTATIONS WITH RESPECT TO ANY THIRD PARTY HARDWARE OR SOFTWARE WITH WHICH THE PisarZ IS DESIGNED TO BE USED, AND Dark_Timur DISCLAIMS ALL LIABILITY WITH RESPECT TO ANY FAILURES THEREOF.
10. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. Notwithstanding any damages that you might incur, the entire liability of Dark_Timur and any of its suppliers under any provision of this EULA and your exclusive remedy for all of the foregoing shall be limited to the greater of the amount actually paid by you for the PisarZ or US$100.00. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL Dark_Timur OR ITS SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, FOR LOSS OF DATA OR OTHER INFORMATION, FOR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, FOR PERSONAL INJURY, FOR LOSS OF PRIVACY ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY RELATED TO THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE PRODUCT, OR OTHERWISE IN CONNECTION WITH ANY PROVISION OF THIS EULA), EVEN IF Dark_Timur OR ANY SUPPLIER HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND EVEN IF THE REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. Some states/jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you.
